### Aim of the experiment
 
To examine chemical equilibrium systems and understand how they respond to external stresses such as changes in concentration, temperature, and pressure, in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle. To explore how the equilibrium position shifts when different variables are altered and predict the direction of these shifts using equilibrium constants. To analyze these changes and gain insight into the dynamic balance between forward and reverse reaction rates in a system at equilibrium. To highlight both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of equilibrium and the factors that influence chemical systems. To ultimately apply this theoretical understanding to practical scenarios and accurately interpret experimental outcomes related to equilibrium behavior.

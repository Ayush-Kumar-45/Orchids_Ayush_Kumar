      "question": "What does Le Chatelier’s Principle state?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Reactions always move to completion",
        "b": "Systems at equilibrium remain unaffected by external changes",
        "c": "A system at equilibrium adjusts to oppose any change imposed on it",
        "d": "Reactants always dominate at equilibrium"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Reactions do not always go to completion.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Equilibrium systems are affected by external changes.",
        "c": "Correct. According to Le Chatelier’s Principle, the system adjusts to oppose the change.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Product and reactant ratios depend on the reaction's equilibrium constant."

    {
      "question": "If temperature is increased in an exothermic reaction at equilibrium, the system will:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Shift to the right (towards products)",
        "b": "Shift to the left (towards reactants)",
        "c": "Remain unchanged",
        "d": "Increase the rate of forward reaction permanently"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Increasing temperature shifts equilibrium in the direction that absorbs heat (endothermic).",
        "b": "Correct. For an exothermic reaction, increasing temperature favors the reverse (endothermic) reaction.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The equilibrium position changes with temperature.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Rate may temporarily change, but equilibrium determines long-term composition."

      "question": "Which of the following changes will shift the equilibrium to the product side?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Removing reactants",
        "b": "Adding more products",
        "c": "Adding more reactants",
        "d": "Decreasing pressure in a gaseous system with fewer moles on the product side"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Removing reactants shifts equilibrium to the left.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Adding products shifts equilibrium to the left.",
        "c": "Correct. Adding reactants drives the reaction toward products.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Decreasing pressure favors the side with more gas molecules."

    {
      "question": "In a gaseous reaction where the product side has fewer moles of gas, increasing pressure will:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Shift equilibrium to the product side",
        "b": "Shift equilibrium to the reactant side",
        "c": "Have no effect on equilibrium",
        "d": "Stop the reaction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Increased pressure favors the side with fewer gas molecules.",
        "b": "Incorrect. More pressure shifts equilibrium toward fewer moles.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Gaseous equilibrium is pressure-sensitive.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Pressure changes shift equilibrium but don’t halt reactions."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following will not affect the position of equilibrium in a closed system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Change in concentration of reactants",
        "b": "Change in pressure for gaseous reactions",
        "c": "Addition of a catalyst",
        "d": "Change in temperature"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Changing concentration alters equilibrium.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Pressure changes affect gaseous equilibria.",
        "c": "Correct. A catalyst speeds up both forward and reverse reactions equally, so equilibrium position is unchanged.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Temperature changes affect the equilibrium constant."

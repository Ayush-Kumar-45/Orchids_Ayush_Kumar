    {
      "question": "For the reaction N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g) + heat, what effect will increasing the temperature have on the equilibrium?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Shift to the left (reactants)",
        "b": "Shift to the right (products)",
        "c": "No shift",
        "d": "Shift to the right, then to the left"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Increasing the temperature favors the endothermic direction, which is the reverse (reactant) direction in this exothermic reaction.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would happen if the reaction were endothermic.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Changes in temperature do affect equilibrium.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The reaction does not shift back and forth immediately in this way."

    {
      "question": "For the reaction 2SO₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2SO₃(g), which of the following will increase the yield of SO₃?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreasing the pressure",
        "b": "Adding more O₂",
        "c": "Adding more SO₃",
        "d": "Increasing the temperature"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Decreasing pressure shifts equilibrium toward more gas molecules (reactants).",
        "b": "Correct. Increasing the concentration of a reactant (O₂) will shift the equilibrium towards the product (SO₃).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Adding product shifts equilibrium to the left.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Increasing temperature may not favor product formation if the reaction is exothermic."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "You increased the concentration of reactant A, and the simulation showed a sharp shift toward product formation. If you immediately double the concentration of product B, what would most likely happen next?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Reaction shifts further to the right",
        "b": "Reaction shifts to the left to counter the excess B",
        "c": "No change occurs",
        "d": "The reaction becomes irreversible"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Increasing product concentration does not push the reaction further forward.",
        "b": "Correct. The system will shift left to oppose the increase in product B.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The system responds to changes even if equilibrium was previously reached.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Equilibrium reactions remain reversible under standard conditions."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the simulation, when you removed some product but did not add any reactants, the reaction still shifted toward the products. Why?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The system tries to restore balance by forming more product",
        "b": "Removing product increases the pressure",
        "c": "Reactants are unstable and must convert",
        "d": "Heat is absorbed spontaneously"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Removing product causes the equilibrium to shift right to restore lost products.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Pressure only changes when gas volume or quantity changes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is not necessarily true for all reactions.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Heat behavior depends on reaction type, not product removal."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "A catalyst is added to a reactor where equilibrium has already been established. What is its effect?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases the yield of the products",
        "b": "It has no effect since equilibrium is already reached",
        "c": "It helps re-establish equilibrium more quickly if disturbed",
        "d": "It lowers the temperature of the system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Catalysts do not affect equilibrium yield.",
        "b": "Incorrect. It doesn’t affect the position but aids reestablishment if disturbed.",
        "c": "Correct. A catalyst speeds up both the forward and reverse reactions, helping to re-establish equilibrium faster.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Catalysts don’t influence temperature."
      },

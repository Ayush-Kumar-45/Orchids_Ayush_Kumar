### LE CHATELIER'S REACTOR
In many chemical reactions, a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached, where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal. At this point, the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time.

Le Chatelier’s Principle explains how an equilibrium system responds when it is subjected to external changes.
### According to the principle:

 “When a system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, it adjusts itself in a way that counteracts that change and re-establishes equilibrium.”



In this virtual experiment, we use a simulated Le Chatelier Reactor to demonstrate how equilibrium shifts in response to various changes. The model helps us visualize how chemical systems adapt to maintain balance when disturbed.




### Key Concepts:

### 1. Effect of Concentration:

Adding more reactants shifts the equilibrium toward the product side to reduce the added substance.

Removing products also drives the reaction forward to replace the removed component.

Example:

Increasing SCN⁻ concentration results in a deeper red color, indicating more FeSCN²⁺ is formed.



### 2. Effect of Temperature:

For exothermic reactions (which release heat), increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium backward (toward reactants).

For endothermic reactions (which absorb heat), raising the temperature shifts the equilibrium forward (toward products).



### 3. Effect of Pressure (only for gases):

Increasing pressure causes the equilibrium to shift toward the side with fewer gas molecules.

Decreasing pressure shifts it toward the side with more gas molecules.

Example:

Applying high pressure favors the production of ammonia, as fewer gas molecules are formed.
